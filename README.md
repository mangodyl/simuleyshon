TODO:

Basic:

- calculate function
- display Point Total on caclulate
- use #f8b500 for important sections for players (i.e. pass 'main' prop or something and use css to change background on blocks for things like Pass Yards for QBs)
- fix grid styling on smaller viewports
- fix general styling
- refactor horrendously repetitive code
- default styles maybe

Additional:

- chat about being able to log stats for each player over the season
